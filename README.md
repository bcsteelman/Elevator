# Elevator

Elevator class with a basic Main method to demonstrate.

Follows the same logic as a person walking into an elevator. Enter is how you begin to enter floors, quit is how you exit the elevator.
Entering 0 is how you simulate the elevator doors closing.     

The elevator is designed to have an input of floors to move to, then move to them. Rather than continuously scanning with a time delay to move floors and the user enters enters floors simulatneously with the elevator moving.   

There is some error checking, however the main focus is the demonstration of the elevator logic, not the demonstrtion program.
